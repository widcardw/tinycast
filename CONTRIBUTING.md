# Contributing to Tinycast

Check existing [issues](https://github.com/abue-ammar/tinycast/issues) and
[pull requests](https://github.com/abue-ammar/tinycast/pulls) first.

> **Don't hurry your code. Make sure it works well and is well designed. Don't worry about timing.**

## Non-negotiables

- **RAM.** Under 100 MB, always. No feature is worth going over.
- **No leaks.** Leak-test before you submit. Zero leaks, no retain cycles, memory back to baseline
  after the palette closes.
- **Design.** New UI must look like it shipped with the app — spacing, type, radii and motion from the
  existing tokens ([`docs/ui.md`](docs/ui.md)). If you genuinely need a new one, justify it in the PR.
- **No bloat.** Tinycast stays small on purpose — quality over quantity. A clean patch still gets
  declined if the feature isn't worth its weight, so open an issue and settle that before you build.
- **Never break the Critical Invariants** in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

## Setup

- macOS 26+, Xcode 26. Do the one-time signing setup ([`docs/signing.md`](docs/signing.md) §1).
- `open Tinycast.xcodeproj` → ⌘R. Debug builds are their own channel (`Tinycast Dev.app`).
- After editing `project.yml`: `xcodegen generate`, commit the result. No SwiftPM.
- Details: [`docs/development.md`](docs/development.md). Architecture:
  [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

## Before submitting

- **A linked issue that got a green light.** No agreed issue, no merge — unless a maintainer marks
  the PR `typo` or `docs`.
- Builds clean — no new warnings.
- The `Tools/` harnesses pass; engine changes come with new cases. CI runs them and SwiftLint on the
  PR, and both are merge gates. It does **not** build the app, so **build locally** —
  a PR that doesn't compile still looks green; [`docs/development.md`](docs/development.md#tests) has
  the commands.
- Leak-tested and memory-measured. Numbers in the PR.
- You actually used the app, on your path and the ones next to it.
- Rebased on `main`, squashed into logical commits.
- Anything in [`docs/`](docs/) your change makes wrong is fixed.
- **Read your own diff top to bottom before you open the PR.** Most review comments are things the
  author would have caught on a second pass.
- You agree to the
  [Contributor License and Feedback Agreement](CONTRIBUTOR_LICENSE_AND_FEEDBACK_AGREEMENT.md).
  Opening a PR is your acceptance.

## Pull requests

- Fill in the [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) — every section, or say why it doesn't
  apply.
- **Visual change → side-by-side before/after video. Mandatory.** Same window size, same actions.
  An "after"-only clip doesn't count; stills don't substitute.
- Non-visual → say what you tested.
- Include the memory numbers, idle and peak.
- Flag anything surprising, and any tradeoff you made on purpose.

## Code style

Match the surrounding code.

- Single-line comments only. Comment the _why_, never the _what_.
- Views stay declarative; logic lives in models and managers.
- Swift 6 isolation — heavy work off the main actor.
- [`Core/Theme.swift`](Tinycast/Core/Theme.swift) tokens only. Read [`docs/ui.md`](docs/ui.md) before
  any new view or restyle. Dark only — no light-mode styling.
- New long-lived state goes on `AppCore`, wired in `start()`.
- Networked features ship **off** and consent-gated. Follow `CurrencyRateStore`.
- Delete dead code. Never hand-edit the generated files.
- Commit messages imperative: `Add per-app hotkey toggle`.

## Bugs

macOS version, Tinycast version + channel, steps, expected vs actual. A recording beats a paragraph.
